So, at first I saw that my office was running a blood donation program.
What is blood donation?

Basically, blood donation is giving our blood to help people who need it, based on their required blood type.

### Story
So after lunch at one company, my friends and I saw a blood donation program at the office. At first my friend joined and invited me. I initially refused because I had not eaten breakfast, but apparently it was still okay, so I joined because a friend teased me by saying, "Are you even a man?" I registered, but when I got to the weight form, I realized I did not know my weight. I weighed myself and it was `47.1`, while it should be `48.*`. When I found out my weight, I decided not to donate, haha.

But in return I finally found out my blood type. I had never checked it before, so I did not know. I learned my blood type when I found out my weight and decided not to donate, haha.
