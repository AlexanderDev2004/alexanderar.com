### About Me

I am a software engineer based in Indonesia with more than 2 years of experience in software development. Most of what I create are web applications and games, but I am open to other platforms as long as it helps people solve the problems they face. I usually use TypeScript for websites and C# for game development. Besides that, I speak Indonesian and English fluently, and currently, I am learning Chinese (中国).
